# Personal Portfolio

This is a polished, responsive personal portfolio built with Bootstrap, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Quick start (local preview):

```bash
# from d:\new portfolio
python -m http.server
# open http://localhost:8000
```

Deployment:
- Push the repository to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages, or
- Connect the repo to Netlify/Vercel and deploy automatically.

Contact form:
- The included contact form is a client-side demo. To receive messages, replace the form handler with a service (Formspree, Netlify Forms) or add a server endpoint.

Replace placeholders:
- Update `index.html` with your real name, email, social links, and `resume-alex-morgan.pdf` (or change filename).

Files added:
- `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, `js/main.js`, `images/` (SVGs), `resume-alex-morgan.pdf` (placeholder)

If you want, I can:
- Replace placeholders with your real details.
- Connect the contact form to Formspree and wire the endpoint.
- Create a GitHub Pages branch and push/commit the site.
